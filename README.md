# SDANAD-Education

In this project, the goal of consolidating the different types and locations of Adventist schools across North America was achieved via the official Adventist Education website. 

The consolidated information will be made into a dynamic map using Tableau so that people considering moving in North America can find, in one place, what Adventist Education options are available where they might be relocating to.
